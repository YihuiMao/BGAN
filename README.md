# BicycleGAN Implementation
change the dataset path to your dataset path 
(line 22 , 23 in train.py and line 32 in dataset.py) 

1.just run python train.py in the directory of BGAN (please make sure the dataset also in the dir)

2.You could also use the train_run_by_notebook.ipynb (but not recommend it), In the note book, I 
download code from the kaggle, you may have to download a kaggle.json from you side. And drag the all 
.py file into the colab. Then start it.
